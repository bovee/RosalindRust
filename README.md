Rosalind Rust
=============

These are problems from rosalind (http://rosalind.info) solved using the rust 
programming language. I am using rosalind as an platform to learn more rust so
the code here (probably) does not follow best practices, but hopefully it
provides some useful examples.


The code should work with Rust 1.0, but uses `old_io` so it may not work beyond that.
